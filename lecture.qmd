> Spike is a bounty hunter who was born on Mars on June 26, 2044. He is 27 years old. Spike has fluffy hair and brown eyes, the left being artificial. He is 6'1" tall and weighs 155 lbs. Spike is a heavy smoker, and is frequently seen smoking. regardless of poor weather and the presence of "no smoking" signs. A skilled martial artist who practices Jeet Kune Do, Spike is a devout follower of the philosophies of Bruce Lee. During gunfights, he often uses a Jericho 941.

## This is data: Tabular {.smaller}

<br />

| first_name | last_name | age | location | sport          | smoker | favorite_gun   |
|------------|-----------|-----|----------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| "Spike"    | "Spiegel" |  27 | "Mars"   | "Jeet Kune Do" | TRUE   | "Jericho 941"  |

<br />

- Tabular data is what most people think of as "data".
- These are the same data elements we had before, arranged as a table.
  - Strings are identified by quotation marks.
  - Numbers and Booleans are not quoted.
- Tabular data cannot easily capture the context or nuance of the paragraph.
  - `smoker = TRUE` is not the same as `Spike is a heavy smoker, and is frequently seen smoking. regardless of poor weather and the presence of "no smoking" signs.`


## This is data: JSON

```
{
  "first_name": "Spike",
  "last_name": "Spiegel",
  "age": 27,
  "location": "Mars",
  "sport": "Jeet Kune Do",
  "smoker": true,
  "favorite_gun": "Jericho 941"
}
```

- JavaScript Object Notation
- This is equivalent to the tabular structure.
- It is commonly used for data exchange.
- This is Internet's native data structure.
- It is a very flexible data format, but doesn't scale easily.


## This is data: CSV

<br />

```
first_name, last_name, age, location, sport,        smoker, favorite_gun
Spike,      Spiegel,    27, Mars,     Jeet Kune Do, true,   Jericho 941
```

- Comma Separated Values
- This is also equivalent to the tabular structure.
- The plain text data format that refuses to die.
- Very simple format.

Sadly, the Cowboy Bebop references must end. 😭


## How can we use data? {.smaller}

- Individual data points:
  - The previous slides give us data about a single character from Cowboy Bebop.
      - If you don't haven't seen this show . . . the weekend is coming.
  - The CVS receipt tells us about a single purchase.
- Summary/Aggregate:
  - What is the average age of characters in Cowboy Bebop?
  - Who is the oldest/youngest character?
  - How many bottles of Ensure were sold last year?
  - How many flu cases were counted last week.
  - What parts of the country are at highest risk of measle outbreaks?

To calculate summary statistics, we use individual data points in aggregate.


## Data is often limited and biased. {.smaller}

![](./includes/flu_cases_2025-2026.png)

> Counts of persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza (“cases”) and counts of persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza who are hospitalized (“hospitalizations”) and are reported to the NYSDOH.

DOH flu data is a proxy for what is actually happening.


## Even when complete, limited.

![](./includes/cvs_receipt.png)

CVS knows how many bottles of Ensure it has sold. But it doesn't know how many bottles are sold at Target.

And I feel that this sums up the interdisciplinary nature of this.

## What skills are needed? (2/3)

[From Wikipedia: Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual
> phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many
> fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and
> computer science.

::: notes
Data science is, yes, a bit math heavy. But it is multi-disciplinary at its
core.

## What skills are needed? (3/3)

[From Wikipedia: Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of
> science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and
> asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of
> information technology" and the data deluge.

::: notes
Others have argues that is is the fourth paradigm.

1. Empirical science is based on observation of the natural world.
  - This would include experimentation, etc.
2. Theoretical science is based on, well, theories. We most closely associate
  this with fields such as math and physics, but it exists in all fields of
  science, including public health.
  - And I'm sure you've been taught, repeatedly, about the scientific process.
  Develop a theory and then prove/disprove it with an experiment. And that's
  the interplay between these first two paradigms.
3. Computational: The ability to use computers to physically model reality has
  had profound impacts on scientific fields such as physics and chemistry. For
  example, our understanding of the long-term impacts of climate change are
  driven by computational models of how all these factors interrelate and
  create feedback loops.
4. This idea of a fourth paradigm comes from a 2009 book cleverly titled "The
  Fourth Paradigm" which argues that data science presents a paradigmatic
  shift in how science is done.

And I both agree with this and disagree with this. On the one hand, empirical
science has always been driven by data. What has changed, fundamentally, is the
scale and scope of this data. And the ease with which we can apply science to
data.

And a big part of this is that the scale and scope of data itself has
fundamentally changed. A linear regression is still just a linear regression.
But now, I often don't need to go out and gather data specifically to look for a
relationship. I often have that data to-hand, simply because of other data
gathering processes already in place.

And for science, this is a big deal. Imagine Darwin if he had not needed to
travel to the Galapagos islands to learn what was there, because that is the
world we live in.

And while this creates new opportunities, it creates new risks. Are there biases
in the data? Are there omissions?

## Questions / Concerns

- Learning data science is not easy.
- Office Hours: Fridays
  - 10:00 - 11:00 & 12:30 - 14:00
  - I don't have an office . . . .
